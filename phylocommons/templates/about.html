<p>
    <strong>PhyloCommons</strong> is a community-edited, annotated repository of
    phylogenetic trees. It simplifies the reuse of published trees and
    aggregates knowledge about each tree that can be used to inform evolutionary
    analyses.
</p>
<p>
    PhyloCommons uses semantic web technologies including RDF to enable quick, efficient 
    reuse of trees. PhyloCommons leverages the open source 
    <a href='http://biopython.org'>BioPython project</a> to convert trees in various 
    formats into RDF. These trees are then stored in Virtuoso, a database optized 
    for RDF storage. This makes common tasks such as querying for specific trees 
    based on metadata (year published, reconstruction method) or creating subtrees 
    from a list of taxa very efficient.
</p>
