        A tree containing only those species
    </td><td>
        On the <a href="/query/">query page</a>, paste the species list (comma 
        separated) into the box and press the "get tree" button.

    </td><td>
        A tree containing those species, plus all others in the same clade
    </td><td>
        On the <a href="/query/">query page</a>, paste the species list (comma 
        separated) into the box. Uncheck the "prune results" box, and press the

    <tr><td>
        Two species names
    </td><td>
        Distance from those species to their most recent common ancestor
    </td><td>
        On the <a href="/query/">query page</a>, paste the species list (comma 
        separated) into the box and press the "get tree" button. With the "prune

        species and their common ancestor.

        PhyloCommons supports higher taxon matching. Follow the instructions 
        above for the type of tree you want, substituting the names of the 
        higher taxa for species names.
    </td></tr>

    <tr><td>
        A list of taxa containing common names or synonyms
    </td><td>
        A tree
    </td><td>
        PhyloCommons can match synonyms, common names, common mispellings, etc. 
        using a taxonomy. By default the NCBI taxonomy is used; this can be changed under "advanced options"
        on the <a href="/query/">query page</a>. Follow the instructions above 
        for the type of tree you want.
