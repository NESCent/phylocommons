phylocommons is a Django web application frontend to the RDF treestore, which 
stores phylogenetic trees in a triple store for easy reuse.


**Installing your own instance of phylocommons**

1. To install phylocommons, first install the RDF treestore:

        git clone https://https://github.com/bendmorris/rdf-treestore.git
        cd rdf-treestore
        sudo python setup.py install

2. You'll need Django version 1.4 installed. phylocommons uses the django-registration plugin
which is not currently compatible with Django 1.5.

3. Open phylocommons/settings.py and change the following settings:

        * DOMAIN: enter your own domain name, i.e. 'http://www.example.org/'.
        * ADMINS: add a list of ('name', 'email@domain.org') tuples for each administrator.
        * TIME_ZONE, LANGUAGE_CODE: you can change these if necessary.
        * TREESTORE_KWARGS: dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed to the Treestore. Common options are 'dsn', 'user', and 'password'.

3. Run `python manage.py syncdb`. You'll be prompted to create a superuser 
account; choose no, and then run `python manage.py createsuperuser`. If you
choose create the superuser through syncdb, you'll need to run create_profiles.py;
see that file for instructions.
