phylocommons is a Django web application frontend to the RDF treestore, which 
stores phylogenetic trees in a triple store for easy reuse.


## Installing your own instance of phylocommons

### Django

You'll need Django version 1.4 installed. phylocommons uses the 
django-registration plugin which is not currently compatible with Django 1.5.

### Virtuoso

You'll also need Virtuoso and the Redland RDF library (with Python bindings
and Virtuoso storage) installed.

### Installation

To install phylocommons, run `make` from the root directory. This will install
the prerequisites (rdf-treestore and biopython) if they aren't already present,
create the SQLite database, and set up the settings/secret key files.

There are variables that can be passed to the `make` command, for example:

    make username='bendmorris' email='ben@bendmorris.com'`

Variables that can be specified include:

* username: the username of the superuser (will be created without a password)
* email: the email address of the superuser
* domain: the domain the site will run from (e.g. http://www.phylocommons.org/)
* treestore_kwargs: a python dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed to the
  RDF treestore; common options are 'dsn', 'user', and 'password'

### Testing

To test PhyloCommons:

* start Virtuoso
* run `python manage.py runserver`
* navigate to localhost:8000 in your web browser
